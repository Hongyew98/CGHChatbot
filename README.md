# CGH AI Chatbot

The main goal of this project is to save time on the entire hiring process.

This will be done through three main features:
- An application management tool to streamline recruitment workflow for HR.
- A 24/7 smart chatbot to facilitate the job application of job seekers.
- AI analysis of potential candidates to help select the best talent profiles without bias.

For the first stage of the project, I will be focusing on developing the structure and interface of the entire web app.

After cloning, use command-line to cd to the project folder and install the necessary packages.
